    <h1>Dog</h1>

    <p>
        <b>The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"> dog</a> or domestic dog</b> (Canis familiaris<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog#cite_note-Alvares2019-4"></a></sup> or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated
        descendant of the wolf which ischaracterized by an upturning
        tail. The dog is derived from an ancient,extinct wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living
        relative.
        [8] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[9][8] by huntergatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7] before
        the development of agriculture.[1]
    </p>

    <p>Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10]
        and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11] Over the
        millennia, dogs
        became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent
        study.[12]

<h2>Html Entities</h2>
There are some symbols we should not put it directly into a html document.<br> 
For example we should not type ampersand symbol directly instead we should do it as,<br> ampersand (amp symbol) semicolon
<b>&amp;</b><br> As you can see <b>an entity should be declared starting with an ampersand symbol and ends with a semicolon.</b><br> Some other examples are, <br>
For greater than symbol it should be <b>ampersand gt semicolon</b>&gt;
